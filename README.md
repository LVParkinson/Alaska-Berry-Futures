### [Alaska Berry Futures](https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/alaska-berry-futures/home) strives to provide current knowledge about northern berry species, expose gaps in our knowledge and inform Alaskans about how we can plan for changing berry resources. 
As of April 2024 the following booklets are available:
- Cloudberry (*Rubus chamaemorus*)
- Blueberry (*Vaccinium uliginosum*)
- Lowbush cranberry / lingonberry (*V. vitis-idaea*)

## This repository
This repo contains data analysis related to some of the figure and statements of the above booklets. 

### Berry harvest by community
`2023.02.08_Alaska vegetation harvest 2016-18.ipynb`

**Found in:**
- Cloudberry, map on page 12
- Blueberry, figure 10
- Lowbush cranberry, figure 2

Uses vegetation harvest spreadsheets from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game [Commuity Subsistence Information System](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sb/CSIS/). For more detail, see the notebook. 

### Freeze thaw, winter icing
`2024.02.23_ABF_FreezeThawDays.ipynb`    

**Found in:**    
- Lingonberry, page 11
  > "**Spring icing:** In a study in Sweden, when winter warming melted snow but then froze again to cover the plants
in ice for weeks or months two winters in a row there was a significant decrease in the number of flowers.50
This is unlikely to be an issue in Southeast Alaska or the Aleutians, but it may be become a problem in some
other parts of the state."

Using [Alaska Climate Research Center](https://akclimate.org/data/data-portal/) historical temperature data to investigate freeze thaw days and snow depth in selected locations across Alaska.     
  

### Wind speed, pollinator success   
`2023.02.16_AK windspeed.ipynb`    

**Found in:**    
This was a preliminary investigation using SNAP [Historical and Projected Hourly Wind Data for Alaskan Communities, 1980-2099](https://catalog.snap.uaf.edu/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/5bdac624-203c-4a65-bfca-1c3f5bf738db).
